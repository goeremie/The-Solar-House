It’s a “pay-it-forward model for solar energy.” To date, the organization has installed 10 solar projects and has been backed by nearly 1,000 people.

Not only does GRID install solar, they also provide invaluable workforce development through installation training programs, SolarCorps Fellowships, and its “Troops to Solar” program.

It's advocacy has also spurred interest from local governments on the topics of community solar adoption, modern energy grid development, and low-income solar access as well!</td>

During a visit to Nigeria, she witnessed a high maternal mortality rate due to lack of proper lighting in medical facilities. She worked with her husband, a solar energy educator, to create a prototype for what would soon become the Solar Suitcase. Every portable Solar Suitcase provides health workers with a reliable source of power and highly efficient lighting. As of December 2016, 2,260 health centers were equipped with solar lighting and over 1 million newborns were delivered in Solar Suitcase facilities too!</td>

It currently has four live projects that are in need of funding, including the Lakota Nation Youth Center in South Dakota.
